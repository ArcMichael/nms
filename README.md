## NMS is a modern management system built with TypeScript, leveraging React for the frontend and Koa for the backend. 
- It provides a complete full-stack solution designed for scalability, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Key Features
- Frontend: Developed using React, supporting Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to enhance development efficiency.
- Backend: Powered by Koa, offering robust functionality such as static file serving, routing, and JSON handling.
- Build Tooling: Integrates Webpack for efficient module bundling, with Babel for transpilation and ESLint for code linting.
- Environment Configuration: Utilizes dotenv for managing environment variables, ensuring flexible and secure configurations.

## Project Structure
- .vscode/: Contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code.
- client/: Houses the frontend code, including React components and resources.
- server/: Contains the backend code and Koa server implementation.
- webpack/: Includes Webpack configuration files.
- .babelrc: Babel configuration file.
- .eslintrc.js: ESLint configuration file.
- .prettierrc.js: Prettier configuration file.
- tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration file.
- package.json: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
- yarn.lock: Ensures consistent dependency versions.
